# 🧪 Testing Skill

A key guide on how to plan and code with testing in mind inclding how to write tests efficiently, how run/debug tests and other crucial information for any coding session. Use this skill whenever planning any development, before coding, while planning tasks, during coding, and during testing. This ensures tests are considered from the start and written correctly

**Path tokens:**

- `{{TESTING_SKILL_DIR}}` resolves to the directory containing this SKILL.md file (the plugin's installed location). Agent and command files use this token so the skill works with any AI coding tool.
- `{{CONTEXT_ROOT}}` resolves to the root of the app/lib under test — the first directory above the current file that contains a `testskill.config.toml`. See [Skill UX & Behaviour](./references/skill-ux-and-behaviour.md) for the full resolution rule and STOP condition.

## 📐 Test Code: Patterns & Practices

**Read [The Test Anatomy](./references/rules/the-test-anatomy.md) before writing any test.**

**📌 Canonical Example:** For a real, working example that demonstrates all patterns, read the test configured in `{{CONTEXT_ROOT}}/testskill.config.toml` under `[canonical_example]`.
