# Test Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: If any of these workflow principles are violated during runtime, **print a bold message to the user that there is a testing violation**.

**Communication**: Follow the UX guidelines in [skill-ux-and-behaviour.md](./skill-ux-and-behaviour.md) for all messages, greetings, violation reporting, and event transcript emission.

This document defines the mandatory sequence of steps for planning and writing tests. Following this workflow ensures tests have proper context, clear definitions of done, and verified quality.

**Session Greeting**: See [skill-ux-and-behaviour.md](./skill-ux-and-behaviour.md)

## Core Principles

1. **Tests define "done"** - The first task in any phase/user story is creating test definitions
2. **Context before code** - Never write tests without `test-plan.md` and `page-analysis.md`
3. **Verification closes the loop** - Every test session ends with the test verifier agent
4. **Testing is integrated, not separate** - Test planning, implementation, and verification are one continuous workflow. Testing tasks and coding tasks co-exist in the same task list, not as separate phases

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: During Task Planning — The Double Gate 🌉 Principle

> **This is the crucial Double Gate 🌉 principle**: Test planning is the first task in each workflow, test verification is the last task/gate. No coding session should happen without these two gates/tasks

When planning feature work or user stories (manually, using SDD framework, or any planning tool):

1. **First task of any phase**: Create test definitions by calling the `testskill.planner` agent, optionally followed by human approval task if config.must_have_human_review_of_plan is equal to true

2. **Last task of any phase**: Ensure tests pass + invoke test verifier agent. This closes the loop and verifies quality

## Example Task List Structure

### Phase: Add Product Search Feature

- [ ] Task 1: Create test plan (invoke testskill.planner agent)
- [ ] Task 2: Ask for human confirmation of the test plan (if config.must_have_human_review_of_plan)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement search API endpoint
- [ ] Task 4: Implement search UI component
- [ ] Task 5: Run testskill.page-analyzer agent (page skeleton now exists)
- [ ] Task 6: Write and verify tests pass (invoke test verifier agent)
```

---

### Step 2: Test planning

The `testskill.planner` agent creates a plan inside test-plan.md. Don't move forward without user confirmation if config.must_have_human_review_of_plan is equal to true

---

### Step 3: Before Coding Tests

**MANDATORY**: Run the `testskill.page-analyzer` agent before writing any test code.

- **Timing**: Call when the page skeleton with elements exists
- **Output**: Creates `page-analysis.md` with elements, network calls, ARIA analysis
- **Rule**: Don't start writing tests without having `page-analysis.md`

---

### Step 4: When Coding Tests

Before writing test code:

1. Ensure `page-analysis.md` exist, if not call the agent `testskill.page-analyzer`. If the page analyzer failed, and `config.stop_when_no_page_analysis` is true -> Stop and print an error
2. **Read the test patterns** - See [Test Code: Patterns & Practices](../SKILL.md#-test-code-patterns--practices)
3. **Reference the test plan** - Use only scenarios defined in `test-plan.md`

### Step 5: After Coding Tests

**MANDATORY**: Invoke the test verifier agent to validate test quality, fix based on its feedback

## Violation Handling

If you encounter these situations, **print a bold warning**. Format all violations per [skill-ux-and-behaviour.md](./skill-ux-and-behaviour.md): include rule reference numbers, use the rule's emoji if one exists, and use the escalation message when the violation is severe.

- **TESTING VIOLATION**: Attempting to write tests without `test-plan.md`
- **TESTING VIOLATION**: Attempting to write tests without `page-analysis.md`
- **TESTING VIOLATION**: Tests completed without running test verifier
- **TESTING VIOLATION**: A successful workflow must end with the final test report, its name is defined in the config file key: config.outputs.test_result_report
- **TESTING VIOLATION**: Skipping mandatory workflow steps
